/*
 * 2020 Tarpeeksi Hyvae Soft
 * 
 * A generic LIFO stack whose data is stored in a contiguous block of memory.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * 
 *   1. Call __create() to set up a new stack.
 * 
 *   2. Use the appropriate helper functions (__push_copy(), __pop(), etc.) to
 *      manipulate the stack.
 * 
 *   3. If the stack is full when pushing a new element onto it, the stack will
 *      be automatically grown to accommodate.
 * 
 *   4. To clear the stack without deallocating its capacity in memory, call
 *      __clear(). Subsequent new elements will be pushed onto the stack starting
 *      at index 0 and using the existing allocated capacity.
 * 
 *   5. To fully deallocate the cache, call __free(). The stack pointer obtained
 *      in (1) will no longer be valid.
